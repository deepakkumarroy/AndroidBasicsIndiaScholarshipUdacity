Hello, I made an App as a part of activity for AndroidBasicIndiaScholarship.

App Name - Cricket Score Keeper
API - 15 or Above

Description - Keeps tracks of the score for both the teams by tapping the specific run button which is made by a team in an innings.
On second inning it calculates the winner team based on runs or wickets. It includes all the validation and also gives details about
from how much runs or wicket the team won.
